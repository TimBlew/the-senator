          Built in 1902 by Utah State Senator Joseph Murdock, The Senator is a 9,000-square-foot home on a quiet street in Heber City — three blocks from Main Street, fifteen minutes from Deer Valley, twenty from Park City. Ten individually appointed rooms across three floors, a cooked-to-order breakfast every morning, and the kind of pace that lets you get your work done and still make it outside before the light changes.
